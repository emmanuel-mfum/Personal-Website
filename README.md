# Personal-Website
Repository for the files of my personal website

These are the files of my website.

The front-end is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.
The back-end is built with Node.js and Express.js.

I also used EJS templates in order to render the same template (navbar and footer) across my website.

The live version of the site can be found here: https://peaceful-wildwood-77593.herokuapp.com/
